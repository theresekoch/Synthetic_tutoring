# Synthetic_tutoring

This repo contains all the code required to do song playbacks for synthetic tutoring of juvenile Zebra finches, as per Dr. Lipkind's recommendations. 

Starting at ~30 days post hatching (dph), juveniles should be kept in inidividual chambers and receive passive playbacks of the 'tutor' song. This is done with the passive_playback.py script. 


At ~40dph they should stop passive playbacks and begin active playbacks, where they must hop on a perch to trigger playback of the 'tutor song'. This is done with the active_playback.py script. 

This code was designed to run on a raspberry pi 3 model B+ with a short bird perch attached to a button or switch connected to GPIO pin 2.
