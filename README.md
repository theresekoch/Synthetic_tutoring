# Synthetic_tutoring

This repo contains all the code required to do song playbacks for synthetic tutoring of juvenile Zebra finches, as per Dr. Lipkind's recommendations. 

Starting at ~30dph, juveniles should be kept in inidividual chambers, and receive passive playbacks of the 'tutor' song. This is done with the passive_playback.py script. 


At ~40dph they should stop passive playbacks and begin active playbacks, where they must hop on a perch to trigger playback of the 'tutor song'. This is in progress.
